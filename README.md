# Bot Butcher (bot-butcher)
Bot Butcher is designed to aggressively identify and eliminate automated spam or "bot" activity on a website or online platform, essentially acting like a "butcher" by quickly and decisively removing unwanted bot interactions; it often uses advanced algorithms to detect and filter out suspicious behavior with high accuracy.
