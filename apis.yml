  Bot Butcher is designed to aggressively identify and eliminate automated spam
  or "bot" activity on a website or online platform, essentially acting like a
  "butcher" by quickly and decisively removing unwanted bot interactions; it
  often uses advanced algorithms to detect and filter out suspicious behavior
  with high accuracy.
